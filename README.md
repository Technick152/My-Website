   This is a simple, mostly html website that I made to test my crunch skill(timed myself while making it) and to improve my web design skills which are currently lacking.
In the future I would like to add more content and more features, and improve the look and feel of the page. Once I am happy with it I will host it and have the link posted, but until then
you will have to copy or download the source files and drag the index.html file to your browser of choice or copy the path.
